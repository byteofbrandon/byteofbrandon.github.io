## Overview
This script monitors file system activity in real-time to detect suspicious behavior patterns commonly associated with ransomware attacks, such as rapid file encryption, extension changes, and suspicious file access patterns.

## Features
- Real-time file system monitoring
- Behavioral analysis of file operations
- Configurable detection thresholds
- Alert system with email notifications
- Logging and reporting capabilities
- Whitelist support for legitimate processes

## Detection Methods
- **File Extension Analysis**: Monitors for mass file extension changes
- **Entropy Detection**: Identifies files with high entropy (encrypted content)
- **Access Pattern Analysis**: Detects unusual file access patterns
- **Process Monitoring**: Tracks suspicious process behavior
- **Network Activity**: Monitors for C2 communications

## Usage
```bash
# Basic monitoring
python ransomware_detector.py --monitor /home/user/Documents

# With custom configuration
python ransomware_detector.py --config detector_config.json --verbose

# Monitor multiple directories
python ransomware_detector.py --monitor /home/user --monitor /var/www --threshold 50
```

## Configuration Example
```json
{
  "monitor_paths": ["/home", "/var/www"],
  "alert_threshold": 25,
  "email_alerts": true,
  "smtp_server": "smtp.company.com",
  "whitelist_processes": ["backup.exe", "antivirus.exe"],
  "log_file": "/var/log/ransomware_detector.log"
}
```
